What am I doing?

I ask myself this everytime I set down to start my work for the week.  As I near the end of the front end portion of this project, I look back and marvel at what I have done.  I had done basic coding before coming to bloc.  I had actually built a website for my place of work.  Is it anything special?  No.  but still, I did it.  Now, as I maintin it, I look thru the code and realize that I could have done so much better.  Of course I correct my mistakes and improve where I can, but to truely learn this porgram, you must practice coding...  then practice more...
